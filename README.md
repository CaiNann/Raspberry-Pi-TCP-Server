# Raspberry-Pi-TCP-Server

#Personal project where I use my raspberry pi 5 as a cloud storage machine.
#I use C to establish a tcp server on the pi, and then expose it so that
#I may access the server from any other machine.

#There will be file upload and download capability as well as encrypted
#user access.
